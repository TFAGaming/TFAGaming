### Who am I?
I'm T.F.A, a 16 years old Discord bot developer. I Joined Discord for the first time in 2017 and started coding Discord bots in 2019. I started firstly learning the programming language JavaScript to make some Discord bots, and then now TypeScript. TypeScript language is super different than JavaScript, this is going to take me a little bit of time of coding.

### What am I doing now?
Welp, I'm just making Discord bots, you know. :trollface:<br>
Jk, I'm working importantly on my server-only bot, which is called "T.F.A's Utilities". It's an advanced auto-moderation bot, like "Sound's Utilities", a bot from a partnered server called "Sound's World" (NOT A 100% COPY). It has a lot of features like auto YouTube statistics changer, multi select-roles menu, economy system, and advanced moderation commands! And while I'm working on this project, I always try new functions and things about MongoDB. I quit of using quick.db or mysql database types, I prefer for now non-sql database types.

### What does my name represents for?
Real life name. My name starts with T, and my last name contains two words: First starts with F and the other is A. That's how my name is **T.F.A**.

### Do I own a server?
Who is a Discord bot developer and doesn't own a server? Join my server now! It's **100%** free!
