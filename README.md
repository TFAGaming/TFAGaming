Hey there! I'm **T.F.A**, I'm 16 years old and a discord bots developer (unverified).<br>I started programming bots since 2019 with my first ever discord account (created on 2017 and deleted in 2020 because It got hacked), I was a noobie and I don't understand programming languages. I started watching some tutorials about discord bots and I started understand how everything works. I used the language **JavaScript** because it is not too complicated like Python, because in Python, you need to make everything in order, but in JS, indeed. Programming discord bots is my favorite hobbie to do in school vacations.
